# adv-css-lab9-christoper-blouin

This lab was a challenge that focused on importing and rendering custom fonts from external sources such as Google Fonts, Adobe Fonts Typekit, and FontSquirrel to mimic news outlet mastheads, and to style the headings to appear similarly to the originals. It also allowed a better understanding of positioning elements relatively and absolutely based on parent or child relationships of the HTML elements.
